            <h2>Why we make this website?</h2>
            <p>RTOG gives players a platform. Players can post their comments and comments on the
                game here. You can also communicate on the platform to find players who share the
                same hobbies with you. Of course, when a player doesn't know how to choose a game, the platform can also advise him on his interests. Everything here is for the player. Of
                course, most of the information here is also provided by the player.</p>
