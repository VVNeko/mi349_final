                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>In Cyberpunk 2077, players are cast into a dark future society. Story happened in a place called "Night City" the metropolis, with its background of the game tells the story of such a person struggle, he grew up in the streets, trying to find their way among the slums, in the endless struggle of gangs and industry giants to survive, grow up in this City full of dirt and sin. Drugs, violence, poverty and dictatorship did not disappear in 2077. Decades later, people still retain their greed, narrowness and cowardice. But it is not only ghosts from the past that continue to haunt humanity, but also new problems from the present.</br></p>
                <p>The spooks have become increasingly violent: the streets are full of junkies addicted to an emerging form of entertainment: "Braindance". Superdreams are cheap, but the thrill of experiencing other people's lives and their emotions is unparalleled, especially when other people's lives are more colorful than their own.</br></p>
                <p>To put it bluntly, Superdream is an electronic album of personal experiences. A special brain expander called THE BD Player feeds data from these digital albums directly into the viewer's nervous system. Superdream allows the viewer to simultaneously experience all the emotions, muscle movements, sensations and more in the recorder's brain.</br></p>
                <p>Depending on the publishing company, super dream album recorded in the content is also very different, some is relatively simple, such as allowing viewers to experience the story of an adventurer, all the excitement, sweat, scenery, insect songbirds, still have that push you forward, not afraid of fear, beyond the physical limits of curiosity.</br></p>
                <p>But superdream shows people a different side of it. Superdreams, secretly created by criminals, enter the memory of a serial killer, allowing the viewer not only to see his abnormal behavior, but also, more frightening, to feel his desire and satisfaction in killing.</p>

                <h2>Setting</h2>
                <p>The production team promised that the game would be true to the "Cyberpunk" style. Players enter the dark future of 2077, a world in which advanced technology is both the savior and the curse of humanity. Designed for adult players, the novel uses multithreaded, nonlinear storylines and revolves around a super-metropolis, Night City, and its surroundings. Players also have the opportunity to roam the open world of the game at will, returning to the famous scenes in Cyberpunk 2077, from the well-known TRPG rules of table role playing game (TRPG), where gangs operate in battle zones, legends flourish in Afterlife, and nostalgic Forlorn Hope. The game will also provide players with a variety of weapons, rifles, implanted drugs, tools and other equipment.</br></p>
                <p>Cyberpunk 2077 is set in a future world of social decay and brutality. Game designer Mike Pondsmith promises that the game will be as detailed as the Wizard series, with a non-linear, complex and exciting gameplay experience.</br></p>
                <p>Players will have their own unique experience in the game. Players can choose to customize their characters from different classes. From homicidal mercenaries to scheming hackers, these characters can be equipped with different kinds of automated devices and deadly weapons.</br></p>
                <p>According to The game's designer, Philip Weber, the failure of a mission in Cyberpunk 2077 does not result in a "rebooted level," which only happens when a player character dies.Each task has a ripple effect on the game's story.Sometimes a player botches a mission, and that can lead to a different path, or even a different ending.</p>
